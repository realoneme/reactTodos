This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

## Intro
This is a simple application that you can use to make some todolist of your own.

Use bootstrap to help me to build the css and I build this app with react.


## How to

There are something that already in the file.So I don't change.

### `npm install`

Install all the reliables.

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br>
See the section about [running tests](#running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.

## For Users
- To add new todo in the panel head, and use 'Enter' to add it to the todo list.
- Check the checkbox to mark that this single item has been done.
- Use the tabs in the panel foot to filter which states you want to check.
- Use the Delete All to delete all the completed ones.
- Double click on a single item could change this item to editable status, and tap on 'Enter' to commit the change.

Enjoy the Simple TODO.
